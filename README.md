TASK 1: DESIGN ALU USING VERILOG
DESCRIPTION:
Step 1: Understand the ALU Functionality
First, you need to fully understand what an ALU does. It performs arithmetic and logic operations on two input operands and generates results based on control signals. The basic operations include:

Arithmetic: Addition, subtraction, etc.
Logical: AND, OR, XOR, etc.
Shift: Left shift, right shift.
Comparison: Greater than, less than, etc.
Step 2: Define the Inputs and Outputs
Inputs:

A and B: The two operands (typically 32-bit).
ALU_op: A set of control signals (usually 3-4 bits) to specify the operation.
Outputs:

Result: The 32-bit result of the operation.
Flags: Optional flags like Zero, Carry, Negative, Overflow.
